# CRUD_1

This is mostly made in PHP. The php files can be found on the public_html folder. I just made it so it's accessible using a Flutter App.
The php and database is mostly online and you can access it either in the flutter app itself or here: https://softeng-sample1.000webhostapp.com/index.php.
The system is basically you can cread student entries, read them, update them, and even delete them.
